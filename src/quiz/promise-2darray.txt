Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.
The sum2DArray function is designed to take a 2-dimensional array as input, 
calculate the sum of all elements within it, and return a promise. This promise 
encapsulates an asynchronous operation, simulated by a timeout function. If 
the input provided to the function is a valid array, the sum is calculated, 
and the promise resolves with this sum. However, if the input is not an array, 
the promise is rejected with a message indicating bad input.

To demonstrate the usage of sum2DArray, two promises are created: 
sumPromise1 and sumPromise2, each with different inputs. sumPromise1 is 
created with a valid 2-dimensional array, thus it should resolve with the sum 
of its elements. Conversely, sumPromise2 is initialized with a string instead of an 
array, so it should reject with a message indicating bad input. Both promises are 
then handled using .then() and .catch() methods to appropriately manage resolution and rejection. 
Finally, the promises along with their states are logged to the console for observation.
